# Process Scheduling Algorithms

This C program takes input from the user about process details and displays a Gantt chart, average turnaround time, and average waiting time in the terminal by defined CPU scheduling algorithms. 

The program implements the following CPU scheduling algorithms:
* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) - Preemptive

### How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the program and enter the number of processes.
3. Enter the details of each process, including its name, burst time, and arrival time.
4. The program will display the Gantt chart and the average waiting time and average turnaround time for each CPU scheduling algorithm.
